These are the MATLAB, measurement, CAD, and COMSOL files used in the article:
" Modeling, experimental validation, and model order reduction of mirror thermal dynamics "

In every folder, there is a "readme.txt" file that thoroughly describes the files in that folder.

Here is a brief explanation of the folders:

- The folder "preliminary calculations" contains measurement and MATLAB files used to 
convert raw measurements into temperature readings and to generate data files that are used in COMSOL simulations.

- The folder "8_inch_al_mirror_prototype" contains MATLAB, data, and COMSOL files used to perform simulations
on the 8-inch mirror model.

- The folder "honeycomb_mirrors" contains MATLAB, data, CAD, and COMSOL files used to perform simulations
on the honeycomb mirror model. This folder also contains a CAD file that describes the honeycomb mirror geometry.
