Explanation of the files in this folder:

"Component_5_8inch v1.sat" - this file describes the CAD geometry of the honeycomb mirror. This file is imported in COMSOL.

"honeycomb_al.mph", "honeycomb_Beryllium.mph", "honeycomb_ule.mph", "honeycomb_zerodur.mph" - these COMSOL files set up
the COMSOL simulations. These files import the geometry from "Component_5_8inch v1.sat" . Note that you might have to 
update the import path. Also, these files are used to generate the files: 
"state_space_export_honeycomb_aluminum.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_beryllium.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_ule.m",
and "state_space_export_honeycomb_zerodur.m". Also, note that these files are later modified.


"state_space_export_honeycomb_aluminum.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_beryllium.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_ule.m",
and "state_space_export_honeycomb_zerodur.m" - these files are used to extract the state-space matrices.

"model_reduction_aluminum.m", "model_reduction_beryllium.m", "model_reduction_ule.m", "model_reduction_zerodur.m" 
- these files are used to perform model order reduction. Note that these files import matlab data files that
are generated by the following files: "state_space_export_honeycomb_aluminum.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_beryllium.m", "state_space_export_honeycomb_ule.m",
and "state_space_export_honeycomb_zerodur.m"


These files are used to generate Fig. 11 in the paper.
